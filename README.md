# Skwargs
This is a package that is used to update a map with "kwargs" (just an array of Strings with the format "key = value")

import Skwargs.Skwargs; // will import it


it only has 1 overloaded method and that is:

public static Map<String, String> generate(Map<String, String> dict, String[] kwargs, String ... nothing) 

public static Map<String, Integer> generate(Map<String, Integer> dict, String[] kwargs, int ... nothing)


This returns the inputed map but updated with the kwargs. The variable nothing is included because java doesn't like it if it's not but the variable does nothing.


If you want to contact me email me at GoldenGuy1000Contact@gmail.com


This will be updated from time to time
